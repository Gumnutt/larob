## Storybook setup:

- at the root .storybook folder contains the config for stories.
- initial install followed:
  https://git.drupalcode.org/project/cl_server/-/blob/2.x/docs/storybook.md?ref_type=heads
- rather than yarn add, npm install was used to install the dependencies.
- "npx storybook@latest init -t server"
- "npm install --save-dev @lullabot/storybook-drupal-addon"
- "npm run storybook"

- currently not working for SDC, looks like version issues with the
  storybook-drupal-addon.
- still works with example stories in the themestories folder.
